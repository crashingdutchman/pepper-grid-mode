Converts the Dutch Pepper website from row-mode to grid mode.

This is a start and might need improvement!

The layout is not quite how I would like it to be, but it is good enough for now.

Known issues:
- If you open a page and then go back to the grid, you do not exactly return to the grid with the product you clicked on. Scroll up a bit and you will see that product again. Of course, you can also open each link in a new page.
- Dark mode shows a white background for the grid items
